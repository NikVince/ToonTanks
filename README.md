# Toon Tanks

My fourth project from the "Unreal Engine 5 C++ Developer" course by GameDev.tv - a fun, arcade-style tank battle game.

## Current Progress

I'm actively working through this project as part of my C++ and Unreal Engine learning journey. So far, I've implemented:

- Basic tank pawn setup with custom components
- Player-controlled tank movement and turret rotation
- Camera setup and player input binding
- Manual Tank and automatic Turret rotation

## My Learning Goals

With Toon Tanks, I'm building on the foundation established in previous projects to understand more complex gameplay systems. Key concepts I'm focusing on include:

- Parent-child class inheritance in Unreal's C++ framework
- Component-based architecture for different game elements
- Player input processing and camera control
- Separating turret rotation from base movement

## What's Coming Next

As I continue working through the course, I plan to implement:

- Projectile firing mechanics
- Enemy tank AI behavior
- Health system and destruction effects
- Game mode with win/lose conditions
- Audio and visual polish

## Development Environment

This project is being developed with:
- Unreal Engine 5
- Visual Studio with C++ tools
- GameDev.tv course materials as reference

## Personal Reflections

Toon Tanks represents a significant step up in complexity from my previous projects. The separation of concerns between different gameplay elements is teaching me valuable lessons about code organization and class design. 

The turret rotation system was particularly interesting to implement, as it required me to understand how to handle different coordinate spaces and rotation calculations in Unreal Engine.

## Setup Instructions

To explore my current progress:
1. Clone this repository
2. Right-click the .uproject file and generate Visual Studio project files
3. Build the solution
4. Open the project in Unreal Engine 5

## Acknowledgments

I'm grateful to the GameDev.tv team for their excellent course structure and teaching approach. This project is helping me build confidence with C++ in regards to Unreal Engine as I work toward more advanced game development skills.

*Note: This project is still in active development as I progress through the course.*
